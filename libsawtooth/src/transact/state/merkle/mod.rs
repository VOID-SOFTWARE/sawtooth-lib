//! Merkle-Radix Tree state.
//!
//! ## Merkle Hashes
//!
//! Transact provides an addressable Merkle-Radix tree to store data for state. Letâ€™s break that
//! down: The tree is a Merkle tree because it is a copy-on-write data structure which stores
//! successive node hashes from leaf-to-root upon any changes to the tree. For a given set of state
//! transitions, we can generate a single root hash which points to that version of the tree.
//!
//! The root hash can be used to verify that the same set of state transitions applied against the
//! same state ID in another database will produce the same results.
//!
//! ## Radix Addresses
//!
//! The tree is an addressable Radix tree because addresses uniquely identify the paths to leaf
//! nodes in the tree where information is stored. An address is a hex-encoded byte array.  In the
//! tree implementation, each byte is a Radix path segment which identifies the next node in the
//! path to the leaf containing the data associated with the address. This gives the tree a branch
//! factor of 256.
//!
//! ## State Pruning
//!
//! Transact's implementation of the merkle-radix tree for state includes the
//! [`Prune`](crate::state::Prune) trait.
//!
//! A given State root can be viewed as a successor to a previous state root on which it was built.
//! Using this knowledge, pruning operates in one of two ways, depending on where in the chain of
//! successors a given root is.
//!
//! * If state root has successors, then all of the nodes that were removed during the creation of
//!   the root are removed. In other words, any data that would not be accessible from the given
//!   state root from prior state roots would be removed.
//! * If a state root has no successors (it's the tip of a successor chain), then all of the nodes
//!   that were added by that state root are removed. In other words, any data that would not be
//!   accessible by any other state root that still exists in the tree.
//!
//! The later method exists in service of removing forks in a successor chain of a tree.
